# Powerschool Plus
The Powerschool Plus Google Chrome extension was built so that students can manage their grades more efficiently. At the school that I attend, the option for students to view their GPAs were disabled (for some reason). This extension allows students to view their grade point averages without having to calculate it manually.

It also includes a dark mode, but I've been told that the color contrast is not great.
